# Invisible Watermarking System Documentation

Welcome to the Invisible Watermarking System! This document provides an in-depth explanation of the project, outlining the motivations, technical approaches, system architecture, and the innovations that make this solution particularly effective for privacy-preserving digital watermarking.

## 1. Overview

The Invisible Watermarking System is a cutting-edge solution that employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technologies—specifically through Concrete ML—to embed hidden watermarks into digital images. The key innovation lies in performing watermarking directly on encrypted images, ensuring that the original image data remains confidential throughout the processing pipeline. This approach addresses stringent privacy requirements and meets modern regulatory demands, such as those stipulated by the EU AI Act.

### Key Features:
- **Privacy-Preserving Operations:** All image processing is conducted on encrypted data, minimizing exposure of sensitive content.
- **Invisible Watermarking:** The watermarking process is designed to leave no perceptible trace on the image, thereby maintaining the original image quality.
- **Robust against Transformations:** The system is resilient to common image modifications (e.g., JPEG compression) while still allowing for reliable extraction of the watermark.
- **Flexible Watermark Types:** Supports both text/bytes watermarks and image-based watermarks based on the needs of copyright protection, authentication, and digital tracking.

## 2. Project Motivation

This project was developed in response to the bounty challenge "Create a Privacy-Preserving Invisible Image Watermarking System using Concrete ML" (#134). The central problems addressed include:
- **Data Privacy:** Ensuring that image content remains confidential even during processing.
- **Authenticity & Traceability:** Embedding imperceptible markers that verify ownership and detect tampering.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Aligning with emerging privacy laws and digital content regulation standards.
- **Trustless Processing:** Enabling third-party or cloud-based watermarking services to operate without needing access to the unencrypted image.

## 3. System Architecture and Module Breakdown

The solution is organized into a modular structure to enhance clarity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Here’s how the package is structured:

- **invisible_watermark/core:**  
  Contains the core algorithms for watermark embedding and extraction. This module implements sophisticated techniques to ensure that the watermark is both invisible and resilient.

- **invisible_watermark/fhe:**  
  Houses the fully homomorphic encryption components, using Concrete ML to perform computations on encrypted data. This is the heart of the privacy-preserving mechanism, ensuring that all data remains confidential during processing.

- **invisible_watermark/server:**  
  Implements a client-server architecture to enable remote watermarking services. The design supports a trustless environment where the server processes encrypted images without access to the clear data.

- **invisible_watermark/utils:**  
  Provides auxiliary functions for image processing, logging, and pre-/post-processing steps that ensure optimal integration between the watermarking algorithm and FHE components.

## 4. Technical Approach and Methodologies

### A. Invisible Watermarking Techniques

Watermarking is achieved by modifying the image data subtly so that the watermark remains imperceptible while being detectable by our extraction algorithm. Two notable approaches include:

- **LSB (Least Significant Bit) Embedding:**  
  This traditional method changes the least significant bits in the pixel values. Although simple, it has been carefully enhanced to ensure robustness against standard image transformations.

- **Transform Domain Methods:**  
  Techniques such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are explored to embed watermarks in transformed coefficients. These methods offer increased resilience against image compression and scaling.

### B. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

The deployment of FHE using Concrete ML is a transformative aspect of this project:
- **Privacy Preservation:**  
  FHE allows computations (like watermark embedding and extraction) to be executed directly on encrypted data without needing decryption, ensuring that sensitive image contents are never exposed.

- **Secure Outsourcing:**  
  The FHE framework enables trustless services, meaning that the watermarking process can be safely delegated to untrusted external servers, making it practical for cloud-based applications.

### C. Ensuring Robustness and Fidelity

- **Preprocessing:**  
  Before encryption, preprocessing steps adjust the image and watermark parameters to optimize embedding without degrading visual quality.

- **Postprocessing and Validation:**  
  Following watermark extraction, quality checks and error correction techniques ensure that the watermark remains intact and detectable, even after transformations like JPEG compression.

- **Scalability:**  
  Initial implementations are demonstrated on smaller image sizes to minimize FHE computational overhead (e.g., 32x32 or 48x48). However, the architecture is designed to scale to larger images without compromising FHE functionality or watermark integrity.

## 5. Problem Tackling and Benefits

### Challenges Addressed:
- **Invisibility:**  
  The watermark is designed to be completely invisible to the human eye, preserving the aesthetic integrity of the original image.
  
- **Security and Privacy:**  
  By embedding watermarks in the encrypted domain, the system prevents any exposure of the image content, which is critical in scenarios requiring high levels of data confidentiality.

- **Performance Efficiency:**  
  Despite the heavy computational nature of FHE operations, the system is optimized to maintain a balance between robust security and operational efficiency.

### Benefits:
- **Enhanced Copyright Protection:**  
  The embedded watermark provides a reliable means of proving image ownership and detecting unauthorized modifications.
  
- **Trustless Service Provisioning:**  
  With FHE, watermarking services can be outsourced safely, allowing businesses to leverage cloud resources without sacrificing privacy.
  
- **Regulatory Alignment:**  
  The solution meets emerging legal requirements regarding digital media processing and privacy, making it a forward-thinking implementation suitable for modern applications.
